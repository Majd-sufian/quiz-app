Step 1: Set up the development environment.

- Create a new Next.js project.
- Install the necessary dependencies, such as MongoDB driver, Redux, and any styling library.

Step 2: Design the database schema.

- Design the database schema for storing user data and quiz questions.
- Create a MongoDB database and collections using the designed schema.

Step 3: Implement the backend API.

- Create a Node.js server using Express.js.
- Implement RESTful API endpoints for user management and quiz creation.
- Use MongoDB to store and retrieve user data and quiz questions.

Step 4: Implement the frontend application.

- Create a Next.js application to display the user interface.
- Use Redux to manage the state of the application.
- Use the backend API to fetch and submit data.

Step 5: Implement user authentication.

- Implement user authentication using a library such as NextAuth.js.
- Allow users to sign up and log in to the application.

Step 6: Implement questions taking.

- Implement a question taking form in the frontend application.
- Fetch the quizzes from the database using the backend API.
- Display the quizzes to the users and allow them to answer the questions.
- Submit the users' answers to the backend API and calculate their scores. --missing

Step 7: Test the application.

- Thoroughly test the application to ensure that it meets all of the coding challenge requirements and that it is free of bugs.

Step 8: Deploy the application.

- Push code to Github.
- Handle the coding challenge with instructions on how to use and manage the application.
